**Description of Repo Files:**

*Status: Solutions are in progress. Chapters 1-4 are **completed** and Chapter 5 is in progress.*

This repo contains my solutions to the coding problems from the textbook Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science 
Applications. Each of directory in the repo corresponds to a chapter. Directories include of solutions to assignments and in some
cases, supporting modules. See the "File Information" text file in each directory for details.

Note that this repo does not include solutions to the written math problems. Feel free to contact me if you have questions about those.
My email is on my Github page :).

The six files in the main repo are used in various chapters. These files were provided in the textbook and consist of predefined 
modules, procedures, or classes. Some assignments included editing these files (e.g. writing unfinished or new procedres). See the 
chapter directories for assignment details.
